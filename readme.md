# Roman Numerals Converter

A friend of mine had a job test to write a converter from Arabic numerals to Roman, so naturally I thought I could do the same.
I thought, however, that I may as well make it challenging and try to convert Roman numerals to Arabic as well. So I looked into
the rules (and supposed a few), and programmed up a converter either way.

Most of the rules are listed on [this very helpful site](http://www.free-online-calculator-use.com/roman-numeral-converter.html), 
but I also had to assume left-to-right reading, decreasing order of numerals, and subtraction before addition.
Note that this converter will convert Roman numerals like "ixi" (which is not standard, but doesn't break the rules) to 10, but also 
gives the standard Roman numerals for this value (try "ixiv").

I started this project in [this somewhat useful site](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php) because I've recently 
fresh installed Windows and haven't installed Eclipse yet. Then I used Notepad to finish up the fine details. If the notation
(indentation, etc) is messy I apologise.
